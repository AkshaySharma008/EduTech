             which makes her order him, the Red Knights and a Bloodhound (who has a 
             wife and children imprisoned) to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, Alice 
             enters the Tulgey Woods where she is greeted by a grinning vanishing Cheshire 
             Cat who guides her to the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse's tea party.
              The Hatter explains to Alice that he joined the resistance because the Red
               Queen destroyed his entire village and killed his family when she first
               
               ruled Wonderland. He later helps Alice to avoid capture by allowing 
               himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound,
                but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At Salazen Grum castle,
                 the Red Queen notices Alice when she ate Upelkuchen (a cake labeled 
                 'Eat Me' which makes the consumer grow) during a game of Croquet with
                  flamingos and hedgehogs, but is unaware of her true identity because
                   Alice pretended to be called "Um" and therefore welcomes her as
                    a guest. Alice learns that the vorpal sword, the only weapon
                     capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den
                      of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice,
                       but she rebuffs him, causing the jealous Red Queen demanding
                        for Alice to be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends
                         the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on
                          the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the
                           sword to the White Queen. The White Queen gives Alice
                            a potion that returns her normal size and rewards her
                             with a suit of armor when she battles the Jabberwocky
                             . The Cheshire Cat saves the Mad Hatter from the executioner
                              by disguising himself as him in exchange for borrowing his beloved hat.
                               The Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen, which all 
                               her subjects agree to by starting to shout out "Down with Bloody
                                Big Head." The rebellion is quickly put down when the Jubjub
                                 bird begins to kill every illoyal subject, but the resistance
                                  manages to free the Bloodhound's family and flees to the 
                                  White Queen's castle; both armies prepare for battle on 
                                  Frabjous Day. The Caterpillar finally gets Alice to remember
                                   that she has been to Wonderland when she was a little girl, 
                                   and advises her to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing 
                                   his transformation into a pupa.
